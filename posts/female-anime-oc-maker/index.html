While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=anime-girls-oc-i-have-made-with-anime-creator--wiki--anime-amino-1>Anime Girls Oc I Have Made With Anime Creator | Wiki | Anime Amino<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#anime-girls-oc-i-have-made-with-anime-creator--wiki--anime-amino-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://pm1.narvii.com/6276/bb93f32315354eb15bf88d576bd0ca2eda69df1e_hq.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hNFFvDC2i2pZX6JmxXGYrAHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Anime girls oc I have made with anime creator | Wiki | Anime Amino"><p><em>Source: aminoapps.com</em></p><blockquote><p>oc.</p></blockquote><p>Recommendations for watching anime: You can
